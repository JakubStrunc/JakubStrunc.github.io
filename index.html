              <p style="font-size: 1.3rem;">
                I enjoy new challenges, am ambitious, and continually learn new things. During my high school studies in Vancouver, Canada, I led a robotics team for two years, which reached the provincial finals and even the world championship. During my two years at the University of West Bohemia in Plzeň, I gained IT experience ranging from programming in various languages such as C, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, to working with Git, SQL databases, testing web applications, and creating interactive applications for visualization. I am passionate about programming, enjoy learning new things, and creating new projects; therefore, I am looking for a job opportunity where I can apply and expand my skills while contributing to the development of IT products.
